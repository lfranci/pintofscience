Code to analyse the gender bias at the Brazilian Pint of Science. This was a personal project.
I noticed that in the Pinf od Science in Curitiba there ware much more male than female speakers. I used this code to investigate whether the same bias occurred in a national scale. For this, I extracted the data in HTML directly from the Pint of Science web site.
Sadly, what I found is that in the whole country, only 36% of the speakers were women.
